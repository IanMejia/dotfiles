# Ian's st build

This is my personal build of st, it uses my particular modification of the
gruvbox colorscheme. Some of the applied patches include:

* Scrollback functionality with `Shift + MouseWheel`

* Ligature support, it should work with any type of font, provided that you
  configure the *config.h* properly

* Alpha, which adds transparencies. I don't particularly use nowadays, but it
  looks quite pretty on the scrots

This particular config.h makes use of *Fira Code* as the main font.
